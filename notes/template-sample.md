### Description

This map illustrates "person area" per building footprint in Barcelona via data from [CartoBCN](http://w20.bcn.cat/cartobcn/), available in CartoDB's Data Library.

Buttons toggle different CSS renderings of the "plain" or simple building footprints and the choropleth of person area per footprint.

#### Herramientas y materiales empleados (soft, hw, repositiorios, etcâ€¦)

The project is written in HTML and JS, using open data from CartoBCN and CartoDB's Common Data library. The repository linked below has a breakdown of the process to build this project, including checkpoints for dealing with the data.

In the future, I would like to:

* make more maps with these data
* develop additional documentation for the Data Library on Cartodb.com
